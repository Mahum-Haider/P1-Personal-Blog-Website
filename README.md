This is the first project of the Udacity Front End Development NanoDegree

## Personal Blog Website
This project requires you to utilize your HTML and CSS skills to build out a personal blog-homepage and blog-post, including custom images, layout, and styling. Along with webpage design considerations, you'll work to appropriately structure your files, as well as use proper CSS and HTML formatting & style.

## Project Files
